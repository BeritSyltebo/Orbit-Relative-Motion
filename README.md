# Orbit-Relative-Motion

## Description

Comparison of non-linear and linearized models for relative motion between deputy and chief satellites in orbit

## Background

WIP

## Problem Statement

### 14.3

Using the chief and deputy orbit elements in problem 14.2, compute the relative orbit using both the nonlinear relative equations of motion in Eq. (14.13) and the linear CW equations in Eq. (14.21) for different chief orbit eccentricities. Start with a zero eccentricity and increase it until a critical value is found where the CW relative orbit calculation is off by 1 km. When mapping chief and deputy orbit elements into Hill frame coordinates, try both cases where these are wither the rectilinear (_x, y, z_) coordinates or the curvilinear (_&delta;r, s, z_) coordinates.
